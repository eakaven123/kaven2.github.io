    <h4>Explore the connection between economic state and happiness through a scatter plot. Generally, we observe that higher average GDP per capita correlates with greater happiness. However, an interesting insight emerges as North America has the highest average GDP per capita, yet it doesn't have the highest happiness. Instead, Australia and New Zealand, which we identified as the region with the highest happiness with the black box annotation, has the third highest average GDP per capita. This intriguing disparity highlights that while wealth contributes to happiness, other factors also play significant roles in determining overall happiness.
